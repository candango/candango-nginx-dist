# Candango NGINX Distribution

Nginx distribution packed by Canango Open Source Group.

This distribution is based on the original NGINX distribution and will be hosted by Candango OSG.

Initially the RPM distribution for CentOS 7 will be supported and we're adding the ldap auth dynamic module to our repository.
